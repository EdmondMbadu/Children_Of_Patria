If someone wants to do business during, or after, closing come and get me no matter who it is. Understand?”\n" +

                "“Uhh, yeah.” You say. “There was a man walking around the edges of town when everyone was in the meeting. When he realized I saw him he just kind of looked at me for a while, then he slipped behind the tannery.”\n" +
                "David looks at Hilda, then back at you. “Thank you.” He says. “Go get some food, then go to bed early. We have a lot to talk about.”\n" +
                "“Have a good night Ben.” Hilda says.\n" +
                "You do as they say and once you finish eating you go to your room, not much larger than a closet, and lay on your bed. Every so often you hear them talking as you drift to asleep.\n";
